                            <p>Hello, my name is Huan Nguyen and welcome to the first webpage that I've designed as a
                                student of the UCB
                                Full Stack Bootcamp. I'm excited to see how this page evolves as I advanced through the
                                bootcamp.

                                Shifting the focus on my background, I'll say that being in this bootcamp has brought
                                back
                                nostalgic
                                memories for me. I went to UC Berkeley for my undergraduate studies and left with a
                                degree
                                in Biology.
                                Since then I've had industry experience in the biotech scope working as a lab technician
                                to
                                my current
                                position as hardware automation engineer. My love for programming languages stemmed from
                                my
                                experience
                                working as a automation engineer where I had to qualify, validate and program robotic
                                liquid
                                handlers.
                                Ultimately my goal from this bootcamp is to acquire the skills to transition my career
                                to a
                                software
                                focused engineer.</p>
                            <p>During my spare time, I like to dabble in baking and recreating some of my favorite
                                desserts
                                such as ice
                                cream and fluffy cheesecake. Aside from food, I'm an avid snow boarder and follower of
                                sports. As a Bay
                                Area Native, I naturally root for the Dubs and Niners. Please reach out to me and
                                network,
                                I'd love to
                                chat about programming languages, food, snowboarding and sports.</p>
